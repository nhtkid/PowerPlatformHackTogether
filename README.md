# PowerPlatformHackTogether

I am submitting a solution to use Power Automate Cloud Flow designed to monitor your company's customer service mailbox management.

## Features

- **Email Monitoring**: This flow actively tracks incoming emails in your customer service mailbox.
- **Categorization**: It automatically classifies emails into different Outlook folders, simplifying organization:
  - *Archive*: For non-actionable emails.
  - *Action*: For emails requiring a response or follow-up.
  - *Urgent*: For critical matters needing immediate attention.
- **Enhanced Prioritization**: This solution aids your Service Desk team in prioritizing their responses effectively.
- **Teams Integration**: Emails classified as *Urgent* trigger notifications in a Teams private channel accessible to escalation managers.
- **Powered by AI**: Thanks to Copilot, and AI Builder with GPT technology, this flow offers advanced classification capabilities.
- **Extensibility**: Easily expand functionality to create tickets in ITSM tools by leveraging compatible connectors.
